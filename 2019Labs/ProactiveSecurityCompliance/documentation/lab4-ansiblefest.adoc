== Lab 4: Proactive Security and Automated Risk Management at scale with Predictive Analytics

*Lab Length: Medium/Average*

=== Goal of Lab 4
The goal of this lab is to introduce you to the proactive security capabilities of Red Hat Insights. In this lab, we will focus only on the specific security features of Red Hat Insights.

=== Introduction
Red Hat Insights is designed to proactively evaluate the security, performance, and stability of your Red Hat systems by providing predictive analytics. Red Hat Insights helps move you from reactive to proactive systems management, delivers actionable intelligence, and increases visibility of infrastructure risks and the latest security threats. Operational analytics from Red Hat Insights empowers you to prevent downtime and avoid firefighting while responding faster to new risks.

Red Hat Insights recommendations are tailored for the individual system where risk is detected. This allows you to be certain that actions identified by Red Hat Insights are validated and have a verified resolution for each detected risk, reducing false positives you may experience from critical risks identified by third-party security scanners. Red Hat Insights provides predictive analysis of security risks in your infrastructure based on a constantly evolving threat feed from Red Hat.

Through analysis of Red Hat Insights metadata and curated knowledge based on over fifteen years of enterprise customer support, Red Hat is able to identify critical security vulnerabilities, statistically frequented risks, and known bad configurations. We scale this knowledge to our customers with Red Hat Insights reporting and alerts, allowing prediction of what will happen on a monitored system, why it will happen, and how to fix a problem before it can occur.

Red Hat Insights functionality is integrated into Red Hatâ€™s Customer Portal, Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat CloudForms, and Red Hat Ansible Tower.  Recommendations from Red Hat Insights are human-readable and in most cases can simply be copy and pasted into the terminal to resolve the issue. You may also automate remediation of hosts in your infrastructure with Red Hat Insights generated Ansible playbooks or with the Red Hat Ansible Tower integration.

=== Lab 4.1 Configuring Red Hat Insights Clients
Red Hat Insights clients have a configuration file (insights-client.conf) which can be modified for your needs. In this lab exercise, we will be configuring both the *ic1.summit.example.com* and *ic4.summit.example.com* clients.

Note that there is also a Red Hat Insights client Ansible role in Ansible galaxy that will install, configure, and register a system to the Red Hat Insights service. We will not be using this Ansible role in this lab exercise, but for your reference, you can find this role in Ansible Galaxy link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/RedHatInsights/insights-client[here].

==== Lab 4.1.1 Updating host *ic1.summit.example.com* to exclude files from being accessed by Red Hat Insights and running the Red Hat Insights collection on this host

. If not already there, log into to the workstation host as *lab-user* from your desktop system replacing *GUID* with your lab's *GUID*. Then, become *root* on the workstation host.
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.green.osp.opentlc.com
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ sudo -i
----

. Log into the *ic1.summit.example.com*. Note that this client has already been registered to Red Hat Insights for you.
+
[source]
----
[root@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh ic1.summit.example.com
----

. Go to the insights directory and look at the default configuration file.
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 ~]# cd /etc/insights-client/
[root@ic1 insights-client]# cat insights-client.conf
[insights-client]
# Example options in this file are the defaults

# Change log level, valid options DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. Default DEBUG
#loglevel=DEBUG

# Log each line executed

----

. You can specify commands and files you don't want to access by creating a remove.conf file. First, notice that a remove.conf does not currently exist.
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 insights-client]# ls
cert-api.access.redhat.com.pem  insights-client.conf  machine-id  redhattools.pub.gpg  rpm.egg  rpm.egg.asc
----
. Let's create the remove.conf file now. In this file, we are telling Red Hat Insights not to access the following files: /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf. We are also telling Red Hat Insights to not access the netstat command. You can use keywords and patterns to hide information from Red Hat Insights. We have commented out the text that would allow you to hide the following keywords and patterns: passwords and super secret keywords. Let's create the remove.conf file and add this text below to this file using the vi text editor.
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 insights-client]# vi remove.conf
----
+
Add this text to the remove.conf file. Type *i* to insert text. Then, copy and paste the text below into the remove.conf file. Then press *Esc* and type *:wq!* to save and exit.
+
[source,txt]
----
[remove]
files=/etc/hosts,/etc/resolve.conf
commands=netstat
#patterns=password,username
#keywords=super$ecret,ultra$ecret
----
. Now, let's change the file permissions to 0600. Note that 0660 file permissions will work on remove.conf and it should inherit the correct selinux types.
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 insights-client]# chmod 0660 remove.conf
----
. Let's take another look at our newly created remove.conf file with the correct file permissions.
+
[source]
[root@ic1 insights-client]# cat ./remove.conf
[remove]
files=/etc/hosts,/etc/resolve.conf
commands=netstat
#patterns=password,username
#keywords=super,ultra

. Now, let's run the Red Hat Insights collection on the ic1 client from the command line.
+
NOTE: You will see warnings detailing information that will not be collected such as the /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf files and the netstat command.

. Now, register this host to Red Hat Insights with the *--display-name* parameter. This parameter allows you to set the displayed hostname to something other than the default for a system within Red Hat Insights. This is useful if you wish to obfuscate the hostnames that are used in analysis. Be aware that hostnames must resolve properly for Ansible playbooks and Red Hat Ansible Tower management to work for automated remediation. As a result, the display name should match a valid hostname, even if it isn't the publicly accessible DNS name.

=== Lab 4.2 Manually fixing the payload injection security issue
Now that both our *ic1.summit.example.com* and *ic4.summit.example.com* hosts are configured and registered with Red Hat Insights, let's fix some security issues reported to us by Red Hat Insights.

In this lab exercise, we will manually fix the specific *Kernel vulnerable to man-in-the-middle via payload injection (CVE-2016-5696)* on the *ic1.summit.example.com* client without causing downtime.

. On the Red Hat Satellite server, log in with *admin* as the user name and *r3dh4t1!* as the password (if not already logged in). Don't forget to replace the *GUID* with your provided *GUID*.

. Navigate to *Insights â†’ Overview*, where you could see all your registered systems, actions summary (highlighted by priority), as well as latest updates from Red Hat.
+
image:images/insightsoverview.png[200,200]
image:images/lab5.2-insightsoverview.png[1000,1000]

. Next, click on *Insights â†’ Inventory* to see all your clients that are registered to Red Hat Insights. In our case, the clients are: *ic1.summit.example.com*  and *ic4.summit.example.com*. Notice that in this view you can also see the number of issues that Red Hat Insights found on your clients as well.
+
image:images/insightsinventory.png[200,200]
image:images/lab5.2-inventory.png[1000,1000]

. Click on the *ic1.summit.example.com* system. You will see the list of issues affecting it when clicking on the system name.
+
image:images/lab5.2-ic1host.png[1000,1000]

. Notice that your system shows up with multiple security vulnerabilities.
+
NOTE: One of the security issues listed is the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability. This is the security issue that says *Kernel vulnerable to side-channel attacks in modern microprocessors(CVE-2017-573/Spectre, CVE-2017-5754/Meltdown)*. To save time, we will NOT be fixing this particular security issue in this lab exercise since the fix for Meltdown and Spectre requires a kernel upgrade, which requires a reboot of the system.
+
NOTE: Our objective is to fix the payload injection problem without causing downtime, and see that it no longer appears as a vulnerability in Red Hat Insights. Specifically, this payload injection problem causes the kernel to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle via payload injection. A flaw was found in the implementation of the Linux kernel's handling of networking challenge ack link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5961[RFC 5961] where an attacker is able to determine the shared counter. This flaw allows an attacker located on different subnet to inject or take over a TCP connection between a server and client without needing to use a traditional man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

. Use your browserâ€™s search function to search for *payload injection*.
+
image:images/lab5.2-CVE-2016-5696.png[1000,1000]
+
NOTE: Reading the description for the vulnerability shows that the sysctl variable is set to a level that allows being exploited. We want to do the active mitigation by changing the sysctl variable and making it permanent on reboot. In this case, we do not want to update the kernel or reboot since we donâ€™t want downtime.

. If not already there, log into to the workstation host as *lab-user* from your desktop system replacing *GUID* with your lab's *GUID*. Then, become *root* on the workstation host.
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.green.osp.opentlc.com
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ sudo -i
----

. Log in to the Red Hat Insights client machine *ic1.summit.example.com*.
+
[source]
----
[root@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh ic1.summit.example.com
----

. Now, as *root*, perform the recommended active mitigation. Edit the */etc/sysctl.conf* file to add the mitigation configuration.
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 ~]# echo "net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 2147483647" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
----
. Next, reload the kernel configuration.
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 ~]# sysctl -p
net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 100
vm.legacy_va_layout = 0
net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 2147483647
----

. After applying the active mitigation, we want to have the system report any changes. Run the following command as root on ic1.summit.example.com:
+
[source]
----
[root@ic1 ~]# insights-client
WARNING: Excluding data from files
Starting to collect Insights data for ic1.summit.example.com

----

. Wait until this step completes before moving to the next step.
. From your Red Hat Satellite UI, click on *Insights â†’ Inventory*.
+
image:images/insightsinventory.png[200,200]
. Click on your client system, *ic1.summit.example.com*. You will notice than the number of actions has decreased.

. Use your browserâ€™s search function to search for *payload injection*. You will notice that this payload injection issue is no longer listed due to fixing the vulnerability.
+
image:images/lab5.2-payloadinjectionsearch-again.png[1000,1000]

. Congratulations, youâ€™re no longer impacted by the payload injection vulnerability!

=== Lab 4.3 Automatically fixing the payload injection security issue using Red Hat Ansible Automation

It is also possible to automate some of the issues with an Ansible Playbook that Red Hat Insights provides us. In the top left corner of every single issue reported by Red Hat Insights,  there is a blue Ansible logo if an Ansible playbook is available. If there is no Ansible playbook available, the Ansible logo is grey.

For this part of the lab exercise, we will fix the payload injection vulnerability in an automated way using an Ansible playbook versus fixing it manually like we did in the previous exercise. We will execute these steps on the *ic4.summit.exmaple.com* client system.

. First, we need to create a plan in which the issues that are found by Red Hat Insights will be solved using an Ansible Playbook provided by Red Hat Insights. In order to do this, from your Red Hat Satellite UI, click on *Insights â†’ Planner*.
+
image:images/lab5.3-planner.png[1000,1000]

. Click on *Create a plan*.
+
image:images/lab5.3-createplan.png[1000,1000]

. Name the plan: *GUID* Payload Remediation. Replacing *GUID* with your lab's *GUID*, select *ic4.summit.example.com* for Specific System and choose the *Kernel vulnerable to man-in-the-middle via payload injection (CVE-2016-5696)* CVE and click on *Save*.
+
NOTE: Since this is a shared Insights environment naming this with your GUID will make it easier to find when its time to select the plan for remediation.
+
image:images/lab5.3-playbookplan.png[1000,1000]

. As you can see, there are two ways to solve this issue: First option is by updating the kernel. The second option is to apply the needed changes to the */etc/sysctl.conf* file, add the mitigation configuration, and reload the kernel configuration.
Red Hat Insights gives us the opportunity to choose the resolution that we want. In this lab exercise, we want to prevent unplanned downtime for this issue, so select *Set sysctl ip4 challenge ack limit* as your preferred choice and then click on the *Save* button.
+
image:images/lab5.3-setlimit.png[1000,1000]

. Once the plan is saved, the planner screen is shown where you can see the newly created plan, as well as the issues it resolves and the systems affected.
+
image:images/lab5.3-plan.png[1000,1000]

. Now that we have a plan built to resolve the Payload vulnerability for *ic4.summit.exampl.com*, we need to sync the Red Hat Insights information with Red Hat Ansible Tower.

. Login with *admin* / *r3dh4t1!* to Red Hat Ansible Tower.

. Click on *Templates* from the main menu at the left. Find the *Insights Facts Scan* job template and click the *rocket ship* to run this job. This Job template will scan the Ansible facts from the host(s) and gather relevant host information necessary to show the Red Hat Insights data for those hosts in Red Hat Ansible Tower.
+
image:images/lab5.3-scanjob.png[1000,1000]

. The Job Details output will pop up and you should let the job run to completion. At the end the Status should show Successful.
+
image:images/lab5.3-scanoutput.png[1000,1000]

. Navigate to *Inventories* and click on *Insights Inventory*.
+
image:images/lab5.3-insightsinv.png[3000,3000]

. Click *Hosts* and click on the host *ic4.summit.example.com*.
+
image:images/lab5.3-insights-hosts.png[3000,3000]

. Scroll down on the HOSTS page for *ic4.summit.example.com*. Click on the *Insights* option (the letter *i*) for this host. Here, you can see all of the risks and vulnerabilities associated with this host. This is the insight data that you scanned in a previous step.

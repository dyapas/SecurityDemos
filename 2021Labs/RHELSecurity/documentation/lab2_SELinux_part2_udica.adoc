= Lab 2 Part 2: How to generate tailored SELinux policies for containers

*Lab Length: Medium/Average (~15 mins)*

== Goal of Lab
The goal of this lab is to understand how you can install udica the tool for generating SELinux security policies for container and generate and load the policy for your container.

== Introduction
The current solution brings several problems with confining containers. For all containers there is just one general SELinux policy(container_t). This cannot fulfill the ideal balance between security and usability for containers.

For certain use cases container type (container_t) is too strict, such as when some directory is bind mounted to container filesystem namespace. This is required to allow container processes to access this directory. On the other hand,  for certain use cases the container type is too loose. There are two main situations when SELinux policy should be tighter.  The first one is network controlling, when all container processes can bind to any network port. The second one is capability controlling, when all container processes can use all Linux capabilities.

To bring a solution which can address the disadvantages mentioned above, the Udica tool was created. Udica is a tool for generating SELinux security policies for containers. The whole concept is based on the "block inheritance" feature inside SELinux's Common Intermediate Language (CIL). This is an intermediate language supported by SELinux utilities.

Udica creates a policy which combines templates using rules inherited from a specified CIL block and rules discovered by the inspection of the container JSON (lightweight data-interchange format) file, which contains mount points and ports definitions.

== Lab 13.1 Installing the udica and podman
The udica example will be performed on the _udica.example.com_ system.

. If not already there, log into to the bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*

    [localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com

. If not already root, become *root* and then log into the _udica.example.com_ system.

    [lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh root@udica.example.com

Repeat steps #1-2 above on a second terminal (this terminal window will also be connected to *udica.example.com*)

First step is to install udica and container runtime engine, in this case _podman_ engine will be used and rest of dependencies

    # yum install -y udica podman setools-console container-selinux

Then, make sure that SELinux is in Enforcinf mode

    # setenforce 1
    # getenforce
    Enforcing

== Lab 13.2 Current situation

Let's start podman container with following parameters:

    # podman run -v /home:/home:ro -v /var/spool:/var/spool:rw -p 21:21 -it ubi8 bash

 - Container will bind mount /home with read only perms
 - Container will bind mount /var/spool with read/write perms
 - Container will publish container's port 21 to the host

Container runs with **container_t** type and **c447,c628** categories.

Access mounted */home* is not working:

    [root@37a3635afb8f /]# cd /home/
    [root@37a3635afb8f home]# ls
    ls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied

Also, access mounted */var/spool* is not working:

    [root@37a3635afb8f home]# cd /var/spool/
    [root@37a3635afb8f spool]# ls
    ls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied
    [root@37a3635afb8f spool]# touch test
    touch: cannot touch 'test': Permission denied

Because there is no allow rule for **container_t** to access */home* and access to */var/spool*. (Please run following commands in second opened terminal)

    # sesearch -A -s container_t -t home_root_t -c dir -p read
    #
    # sesearch -A -s container_t -t var_spool_t -c dir -p read
    #

On the other hand, what is completely allowed is network access.

    # sesearch -A -s container_t -t port_type -c tcp_socket
    allow container_net_domain port_type:tcp_socket { name_bind name_connect recv_msg send_msg };
    allow sandbox_net_domain port_type:tcp_socket { name_bind name_connect recv_msg send_msg };

    # sesearch -A -s container_t -t port_type -c udp_socket
    allow container_net_domain port_type:udp_socket { name_bind recv_msg send_msg };
    allow sandbox_net_domain port_type:udp_socket { name_bind recv_msg send_msg };

It would be great to restrict this access and allow container bind just on tcp port *21* or with the same label.

== Lab 13.3 Creating SELinux policy for container

To create policy for container, it's necessary to have running container for which a policy will be generated. Container from previous chapter will be used.

Let's find container id using *podman ps* command:

    # podman ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS              PORTS   NAMES
    37a3635afb8f   registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8:latest   bash      15 minutes ago   Up 15 minutes ago           heuristic_lewin

Container ID is **37a3635afb8f**.(In your case container ID will be different and please use yours)

To create policy for it **udica** tool could be used. Container will be inspected by running *podman inspect*. Udica takex one parameter which is name of created SELinux security policy.

    # podman inspect 37a3635afb8f | udica  my_container

    Policy my_container with container id 37a3635afb8f created!

    Please load these modules using:
    # semodule -i my_container.cil /usr/share/udica/templates/{base_container.cil,net_container.cil,home_container.cil}

    Restart the container with: "--security-opt label=type:my_container.process" parameter

Policy is generated. Let's follow instructions from output(to install generated SELinux policy):

    # semodule -i my_container.cil /usr/share/udica/templates/{base_container.cil,net_container.cil,home_container.cil}

Let's exit the running container and start new one.

    [root@37a3635afb8f spool]# exit
    # podman run --security-opt label=type:my_container.process -v /home:/home:ro -v /var/spool:/var/spool:rw -p 21:21 -it ubi8 bash

Container is now running with **my_container.process** type:

    # ps -efZ | grep my_container.process
    unconfined_u:system_r:container_runtime_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 root 2275 434  1 13:49 pts/1 00:00:00 podman run --security-opt label=type:my_container.process -v /home:/home:ro -v /var/spool:/var/spool:rw -p 21:21 -it ubi8 bash
    system_u:system_r:my_container.process:s0:c270,c963 root 2317 2305  0 13:49 pts/0 00:00:00 bash

Proof that SELinux now allowing access */home* and */var/spool* mount points:

    [root@814ec56079e5 /]# cd /home
    [root@814ec56079e5 home]# ls
    user

    [root@814ec56079e5 ~]# cd /var/spool/
    [root@814ec56079e5 spool]# touch test
    [root@814ec56079e5 spool]#

Proof that SELinux allows binding only to tcp/udp *21* port.

    [root@5bd8cb2ad911 /]# yum install -y nc
    [root@5bd8cb2ad911 /]# nc -lvp 1111
    Ncat: Version 7.70 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
    Ncat: bind to :::34: Permission denied. QUITTING.
    [root@5bd8cb2ad911 /]# nc -lvp 21
    Ncat: Version 7.60 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )

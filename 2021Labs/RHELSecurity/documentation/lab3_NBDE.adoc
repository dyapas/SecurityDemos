= Lab 3: Secure Decryption of LUKS-Encrypted Volumes Using Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE)

.*Lab Length*
* Medium/Average (~15 mins)

.*Goal*
* Understand how to use Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) to securely decrypt LUKS-encrypted volumes

== 3.1: Introduction
Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) allows the user to encrypt root volumes of hard drives on physical and virtual machines without requiring manual entry of a password when systems are restarted.

Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ (RHEL) implements NBDE with a central server named Tang and a client framework named Clevis. Tang is used to bind data to a secure network. It is stateless and does not require TLS or authentication. Tang does not interact with client keys, so it never obtains identifying information from the client. Clevis provides automated unlocking of LUKS volumes.

Tang and Clevis are generic server and client components that provide network bound encryption. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, they are used in conjunction with LUKS to encrypt and decrypt root and non-root storage volumes to accomplish NBDE.

This lab covers setting up NBDE using the command line interface, but Cockpit also provides the same functionality in `cockpit-storaged`. You are able to add, edit, and remove both passphrase-based keys and key server keys.

You install the *Tang* server on the *NBDE1* server and the Clevis client on *NBDE3*.

== 3.2: Installing the Tang Server
. Navigate to the lab information page from *Lab 0: Setup Steps* and click *CONSOLE* for *NBDE1*:
+
image:images/lab3-console.png[200,200]
+
This page has your environment's power control and consoles.

. Log in to the *NBDE1* server as *root* using *r3dh4t1!* as the password. (If you are prompted for the disk decryption password, it is also *r3d4t1!*).

. Install the `tang` packages:
+
----
[root@nbde1 ~]# yum install tang
----
+
[TIP]
====
To copy and paste text to send to the console without typing into the console directly, press the *T* button at the top right of your console. This is recommended for longer commands.

====

. Enable the `tang` service in `systemd` and open the HTTP port in the firewall:
+
----
[root@nbde1 ~]# systemctl enable tangd.socket --now
[root@nbde1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=http
[root@nbde1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
----
+
Because `tangd` uses the `systemd` socket activation mechanism, the server starts as soon as it receives the first connection. A new set of cryptographic keys is automatically generated upon initial startup.

== 3.3: Installing the Clevis Client
Your *NBDE3* client is already encrypted. In this section, you install the client packages that allow you to decrypt the root device drive upon boot without manual intervention.

. Navigate to the lab information page from *Lab 0: Setup Steps*.
+
This page has your environment's power control and consoles.

. Click the console link for *NBDE3*:
+
image:images/lab3-console2.png[200,200]
+
. Enter the passphrase *r3dh4t1!* for the LUKS-encrypted disk on *NBDE3* to complete the boot process.
+
[TIP]
====
To copy and paste text to send to the console, press the *T* button:

image:images/console-textbox.png[500,500]
====

. Log in to the *NBDE3* server as *root* using *r3dh4t1!* as the password:

. Install the Clevis packages:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# yum install clevis clevis-luks clevis-dracut
----

. Initialize the LUKS binding to the *Tang* server.

+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# clevis luks bind -d /dev/vda2 tang '{"url":"http://nbde1.example.com"}'
----
+
[TIP]
====
To copy and paste the to send to the console, press the *T* button:

image:images/console-textbox.png[500,500]
====
+
This command performs four steps:

* Creates a new key with the same entropy as the LUKS master key
* Encrypts the new key with Clevis
* Stores the Clevis JWE object in the LUKS header with LUKSMeta
* Enables the new key for use with LUKS

. Answer `y` when asked to trust the keys.

. Enter *r3dh4t1!*, which is the existing LUKS password.

This disk can now be unlocked with your existing passphrase, as well as with the Clevis policy.

== 3.4: Verifying the LUKS Header

. Use the `cryptsetup luksDump` command on *NBDE3* to verify that the Clevis JWE object is successfully placed in a LUKS header:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/vda2

----

. Examine the header and expect to see that there are two key slots in the header.
+
The `0` key slot represents the static password you entered when booting the machine for the first time and key slot `1` is the newly added entry by the `clevis luks bind` command.

== 3.5: Enabling Decryption on the Boot Process

. Enter the following command on *NBDE3* to enable the early boot system to process the disk binding:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# dracut -f
----
+
[TIP]
====
Pass the *-vf* parameter if you want to see verbose output.
====

== 3.6: Rebooting NBDE3 and Testing the NBDE Configuration

. Reboot *NBDE3*:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# reboot
----

. Wait for the prompt to come up for the LUKS passphrase and expect *NBDE3* to automatically begin the boot process without requiring you to enter a password.
+
This may take up to five minutes in the virtualized environment.

== 3.7: Initializing the LUKS Binding to the Tang Server using Cockpit

=== 3.7.1: Accessing NBDE2 Console

Your *NBDE2* server is already encrypted. In this section, you install the client packages that allow you to decrypt the root device drive upon boot without manual intervention.

. Navigate to the lab information page from *Lab 0: Setup Steps*.
+
This page has your environment's power control and consoles.

. Click *CONSOLE* for *NBDE2* and use the passphrase *r3dh4t1!* for the LUKS-encrypted disk on *NBDE2*:
+
image:images/lab3-console2.png[200,200]
+
You must enter the passphrase to complete the boot process. You do not need to log in to the machine after unlocking the disk with the passphrase.
+
[TIP]
====
To copy and paste text to send to the console, press the *T* button:

image:images/console-textbox.png[500,500]
====
+
The `cockpit-storaged` package is already installed for you, and Cockpit is already enabled as well.

=== 3.7.2: Initializing the LUKS Binding

In this section, you initialize the LUKS binding to the *Tang* server using Cockpit.

. Go to your *Lab Information* webpage from *Lab 0: Setup Steps* and click *CONSOLE* for your workstation bastion host:
+
image:images/lab1.1-workstationconsole.png[300,300]

. Log in as *lab-user* with *r3dh4t1!* as the password:
+
image:images/lab1.1-labuserlogin.png[300,300]

. Open a Firefox web browser:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_firefox.png[]

. Open link:https://nbde2.example.com:9090/[https://nbde2.example.com:9090/^]:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_firefox_1.png[]

. Log in as *root*, using *r3dh4t1!* for the password.

. Click *Storage*, then click *VirtiO Disk*:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_storage_page.png[]

. Click *Encrypted data* for */dev/vda2*:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_disk_page.png[]

. Click the *Encryption* tab for the disk:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_disk_page_1.png[]
+
. Expect to see the current keys for the disk, and note that at present there is only one passphrase key:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_disk_enc.png[]

. Click the *+* button to add one more key, and expect the modal window to look like this:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_tang_empty.png[]

. Complete the modal window fields as shown, using *nbde1.example.com* as a key server address and *r3dh4t1!* for the existing disk passphrase, then click *Add*:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_tang_filled.png[]

. After giving the system some time to process the request, click *Trust key*:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_tang_confirm.png[]

. Examine the results, and note both the disk passphrase and the key server as your keys for the disk:
+
image:images/nbde_cockpit_keys_result.png[]
+
Expect your key to be different from the key shown in the image.

This disk can now be unlocked with your existing passphrase as well as with the Clevis policy.

= Lab Exercise 0: Setup Steps


== 0.1 Accessing Your Dedicated Lab Environment Using Your Provided GUID

. On your Red Hat^(R)^ Summit-provided laptop, note that the link:https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_summit[*Lab GUID Assignment page*^] is already loaded into your Firefox web browser.
From this page, you are assigned a unique GUID, which you use to access your unique lab environment and systems.

. Select the proper *Lab Code* from the drop-down list. Find the `T9A495 - Creating customized security policy content to automate security compliance` lab.
The activation key is *security*.

. The resulting *Lab Information page* displays your GUID and other useful information about your lab environment.
Take note of your assigned GUID.
You use this GUID to access your lab's environment and systems.
Your GUID is also embedded in your lab environment's host names.
From the *Lab Information page*, you can also access your unique lab environment's power control and consoles.
Go to the last bullet and click `here` to access the environment's power control and consoles.

. Note that one workstation VM is shown on the *power control and consoles page*.
This is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux ^(R)^8 system with GUI. It is the machine that you use throughout all of the exercises in this lab.
Click `CONSOLE`.
Log in as *Lab User* with the password *r3dh4t1!*.

Congratulations, you are in your *graphical console*.


== 0.2 Using the Text Console to Access the Remote Shell

. On your laptop (_not_ in the browser window with the remote desktop), open the `Terminal` application.
Then, enter the following command, replacing `GUID` with your assigned GUID:
+
----
[... ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----
+
For example, if your GUID is `3fa1`, you execute `$ ssh lab-user@workstation-3fa1.rhpds.opentlc.com`.

. If everything works correctly, you end up in the lab's test system shell.
You can confirm this by listing the directory with lab exercises:
+
----
[... ~]$ cd
[... ~]$ ls labs
lab1_introduction  lab2_openscap  lab3_profiles  lab4_ansible  lab5_oval
----

Congratulations, now you are in your *text console*.

== 0.3 Lab-Related Tips

This section contains various tips that may be useful to keep in mind as you are doing the lab exercises.


=== 0.3.1 Command Listings

Shell session listings obey the following conventions:

----
[... ~]$ pwd
/home/lab-user
[... ~]$ cd labs
[... labs]$ ls
lab1_introduction  lab2_openscap  lab3_profiles  lab4_ansible  lab5_oval
[... labs]$ cat /etc/passwd
...
lab-user:x:1000:1000:Lab User:/home/lab-user:/bin/bash
----

- Commands such as `pwd` and `cat /etc/passwd` in this example are prefixed by `[...`, followed by the respective directory name and `]$`.
For reference, in the actual terminal, commands are prefixed also by the current username and hostname--for example, `[lab-user@workstation-3fa1 ~]$`.
- Lines that follow commands and are not commands themselves represent the last command's output.
In the example above, the output of the `ls` command in the `labs` directory is a list of directories with lab exercises.
- Ellipses may be used to indicate multiple output lines that have been omitted because they are of no interest.
In the example above, the output of the `cat /etc/passwd` command contains many lines with the line containing lab-user's entry emphasized by an ellipsis.


=== 0.3.2 Copy and Paste Conventions

Normally, when you select text you want to copy in the document, you press `Ctrl+C` to copy it to the system clipboard, and you paste it from the clipboard to the editor using `Ctrl+V`.

Keep in mind that when you paste to the **terminal console** or **terminal editor**, you have to use `Ctrl+Shift+V` instead of `Ctrl+V`.
The same applies when copying from the Terminal window--you have to use `Ctrl+Shift+C` after selecting the text, not just `Ctrl+C`.


=== 0.3.3 Browser Searches

When you search for an occurrence of text in the Firefox browser, you have the following options:

- Pressing `Ctrl+F`, which brings up the search window.
- Clicking the "hamburger menu" at the top right corner, and clicking the `Find in This Page` entry.
This is the same as the previous option, but it is useful if you have problems with the keyboard shortcut.

- If the browser has the link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/find-in-page-with-preview/[Find in Page^] extension installed, there is a blue icon close to the "hamburger menu" at the top right corner of the browser.
You can click it and start typing the text to search for.
The extension displays previews of the web page next to occurrences of the expression.
